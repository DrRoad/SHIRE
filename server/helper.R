# All the code in this file needs to be copied to your Shiny app, and you need
# to call `withBusyIndicatorUI()` and `withBusyIndicatorServer()` in your app.
# You can also include the `appCSS` in your UI, as the example app shows.

# =============================================

# Set up a button to have an animated loading indicator and a checkmark
# for better user experience
# Need to use with the corresponding `withBusyIndicator` server function
