# SHIRE

 This project is to make a tool for any data scientists or students who want to use various Machine Learning methods. By using the shiny package which is provided by Rstudio, you do not need to know the R code, or R programming to visualize or to make some output records of machine learning models. 
 
You can :
 - use your own .csv data.
 - tune your model to predict output more precisely.
 
this project will be updated often from now onwards. :)
